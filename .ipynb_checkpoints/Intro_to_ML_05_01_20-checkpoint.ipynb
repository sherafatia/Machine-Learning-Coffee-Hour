    "Machine learning is broken down into 3 main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning models utilize algorithms for which the potential outcomes are knowable in advance (i.e. category or numeric range) and can be used to correct the model’s predictions. With supervised ML, the input features and output labels are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Using data such as credit score, credit history, income, etc., we are trying to predict whether an individual is a credit-risk or not. (Known Category: “Credit-Risk” vs. “Not Credit-Risk”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Using features such as Number of Bedrooms, Square Feet, etc., we are trying to predict the market value of a house. (Numeric Range: 50k – 500K).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning: \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning models utilize algorithms for which the potential outcomes are unlabeled. Inferences are made directly from the data without feedback from known outcomes or labels. Since the dataset in in unsupervised ML is unlabeled, the goal is to discover hidden relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An advertising platform segments the U.S. population into smaller groups with similar demographics and purchasing habits so that advertisers can reach their target market with relevant ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning:\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a technique to allow an agent to take actions and interact with its environment so as to maximize total rewards. It essentially models decision making processes. An example of this would be a computer AI for a chess game. "
